                Social media has had an impact on how patients find and evaluate medical professionals 
                and their experiences of modern healthcare. Qualitative research in healthcare has 
                increased its focus on social media. The present study examined 497 
                reviews of hospitals in the Pittsburgh area across three websites: Google, 
                help, and Healthgrades. Using computerized content analysis tools (CATA), 
                we analyzed positive and negative comments to identify key themes. Key themes and words
                included “doctor,” “hospital,” “staff,” and “time.” These findings highlight the importance 
                of medical staff to patient experience. Results indicated that Yelp had the lowest average
                rating. CATA also revealed that the central term for Google reviews was “hospital,” for
                Healthgrades reviews it was “doctor,” and the central term for Yelp reviews was “patient.” 
                These central terms reflect the focus of each website. The present study highlights the importance
                of healthcare professionals understanding the source of reviews and being cautious about how social
                media comments are used in decision-making about the practice. Future research should try to expand
                this approach to other cities and countries to evaluate cross-cultural effects on social media comments.
